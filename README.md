# Alien Explorers — README

Welcome to the Alien Explorers interactive space adventure.  
In this browser-based game, players help aliens find their new home while learning fun facts about each planet in our solar system. Players choose an alien companion to guide them through their journey and collect unique items along the way.

### HOW TO START

**Recommended:**  
Open the file `start.html`  
This is the main entry point to the game. It begins with the alien story, lets you choose your explorer, and launches you into the planetary adventure.

**If you open `index.html` first:**  
No worries. Just click the "Restart Game" button on the screen, and it will loop you back to the proper starting point.
